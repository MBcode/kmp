I found these up a level from cl-kme(&others), around some sparql queries
also dusting off other re: lisp code, and think this is just part of what
I never commited before;(finding too many missing pieces in these public dirs)
&hope to, even if this is not clean, keep from having too many missing pieces.

Should still look at a few other things incl:
https://github.com/turbolent/sicl.git 

github.com/aaltodsg/instans rete based continuous SPARQL qry&update ~(CEP)
 one of the ways to get en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing ability
  not only to clean/synch/..generally make higher level descriptions for making decisions

also look at: lsp/code/project/src/daimrod/dbpedia-sparql https://github.com/daimrod/dbpedia-sparql.git
look at wilbur twinql sicl   &4store stuff ;cl-ntriples cl-rdfxml
vs rml, could get sql-dump2csv2pins have pins2km if needed
  need pont2km could use clips utils km-taxonomy w/work

racer uses wilbur

my old talk bit.ly/TP8gfz about using KM w/hadoop or similar
assume aggregation of numbers/etc can be described explicitly and run off that description
would like a self/auto note taking that produce triples
SELECT DISTINCT * WHERE {?company a dbpedia-owl:Company}
http://www.cray.com/blog/dont-use-hammer-screw-nail-alternatives-regex-sparql/ contains instead of regex
assert/cache quried urIs +try something like github.com/VisualDataWeb/RelFinder
