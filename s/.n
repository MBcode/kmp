I found these up a level from cl-kme(&others), around some sparql queries

Should still look at a few other things incl:

github.com/aaltodsg/instans rete based continuous SPARQL qry&update ~(CEP)
 one of the ways to get en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_event_processing ability
  not only to clean/synch/..generally make higher level descriptions for making decisions
