http://www.slideshare.net/steffenstaab/programming-the-semantic-web-35204953 would be nice4lsp
 need to make things easier, have some thoughts,though might need to step away from some present..

 if I was going to go after a science app, something like this might be nice /if i was a postdoc

Have wanted more than markup in my CV, &want 1ground truth to generate the rest from, so might
 start w/ https://github.com/prat0318/json_resume &do something a little more json-ld &use which
 ever vocabs would be of use.  Also in my KE class review reminded KM can catch much of this&more.
Might use http://rdfs.org/resume-rdf/ -> http://rdfs.org/resume-rdf/cv.rdfs#   .., 
 want it to catch errors (incl time restrictions)that I/others might miss;via logical constraints
 http://www.w3.org/wiki/ResumeRDFOntology -> 
    http://web.archive.org/web/20110723035128/http://captsolo.net/semweb/resume/0.2/cv.rdf
 Could go rdf-> the json above, which goes2may formats, but would not keep all the rdf info
  so look to converting to rdfa.. w/in the final output.
 Lets start by trying to load the .rdf* above, using the Lisp code in this dir.
   Well or any tool that will load them, and output to something that is even easier to use.
(ql 'wilbur)
(with-open-file (stream #P"cv.rdf" :direction :input)
  (setf wilbur:*db*
    (wilbur:parse-db-from-stream stream "http://notional.no-ip.org/cv.rdf")))
#<WILBUR::TEMPORARY-PARSER-DB size 419 {100F1B0603}>
USER(3): (wilbur:query nil !rdfs:label nil) 
USER(4): (length *)

http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/91/ closed/open;I have wanted a hybrid continuum
http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-for-Sustainability/events/172000842/ touched on several;incl1
is it big-data finding correlations, or is science still more hypothesis driven, (or mix)
is it numeric (not necc black-box) or symbolic computation (or mix)
is open v closed world, or a logical continuum that can incl uncertainty&probablility
 
when I'm looking@workflows, I think of data-driven possabilities, so more reactive
 consider lisa.sf.net, mixed in w/km &cnstr like w/https://github.com/ury-marshak/kr.git
many things to look at, incl prob/uncert in DL, but much more out there as well:
