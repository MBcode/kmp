"OpenML is an open ecosystem for machine learning" - anyone using this? Has good sharing / transparency potential http://expdb.cs.kuleuven.be/expdb/  
/ml/src> git_ https://github.com/openml/OpenML.git
"OpenML is an [ML] experiment sharing platform.." part of my orig vision/will check out
## How does it work?
OpenML works much like a data mining challenge platform, such as Kaggle, except that solutions are constructed collaboratively, with anybody free to build on other people's work

Even though aided ML/datamining was a 1st thought, I'd rather do something along the lines of the
 kind of data-fusion that could even be useful in a semantic-desktop much less aided datamining.
I'll look at the new kde and old nepomuk etc, getting my searchs/emails/twitter etc together.
