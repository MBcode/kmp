KM+Protege.stanford.edu  (www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mfkb/km)

Get Protege3.5, jess-tab jess.jar(for now),Start it then: project-&gt configure to select jesstab
batch load https://github.com/MBcode/CLIPSmsc/blob/master/jutl.clp for a few lisp like utils

One of the MachineLearning pprj I use in (cl-)kme uses protege, and I could store/display/edit
 other(km)constructs w/it, incl maybe some other basic (lisp)code;  

Algernon(tab)uses a lisp and is very KM like; I've heard from the lsw2 people abcl can be used.
alg-tab also has a server.  Really just playing right now.
